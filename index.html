        <p>
          My name is Kenton Hoffmann. I am a senior at the School of Information studying user experience design. I enjoy doing usability testing for products and finding ways to improve
          the customer interaction. I enjoy analyzing datasets and using programs like Python to organize and visualize that data in tables and graphs. When I'm not busy with school, I'm busy dancing, playing videogames or
          learning more about Virtual and Augmented Reality. Take a look at some of the projects on my site and view the gallery to learn more about me!

      <h2>Walmart website Usability Testing</h2>
      <p>
        Another Usability report that I conducted with a team, we decided to test the accessibility of Walmart's website.
        We hosted live test sessions where participants navigated the site and tried to complete tasks such as searching for a product,
        adding a product to the shopping cart, and scheduling an in-store pickup. We made recommendations to improve the website's functionality based on results
        from the tests and feedback from interviews with the participants.

      <h2>Top Videogames and their Retention Value</h2>
      <p>
        Continuing the trend, this next project looked at the highest selling videogames of all time and the resale value of a
        mint condition physical copy of the game. I hoped to discover whether factors like the release date or the gaming platform contributed to game's worth.
        Used versions of a game are usually [retty cheap, but mint conditions of classics can sell for over $500 on auction sites like eBay.
