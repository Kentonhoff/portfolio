        <p id = 'introduction-text'>
          My name is Kenton Hoffmann. I recently graduated from the University of Michigan with a Bachelor of Science in Information. During my time on campus, I studied user experience design extensively at the School of Information, conducting usability tests and finding ways to improve
          the consumer interaction of online products. I also took an interest in information analysis, extracting raw data from APIs available online and using programs like Python to organize and visualize that data in tables and graphs. In my free time, I enjoy dancing, playing videogames or
          learning more about Virtual and Augmented Reality. Take a look at some of the projects on my site and view the gallery to learn more about me!

      <p id ="recent-p1-text">
        For our final senior capstone course, we conducted usability testing for the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) website, focusing on the browsing capabilties of the "Find Data" page and the search results page when users searched for data. ICPSR stores over 14,000 academic studies and datasets on their site,
        so we wanted to help users search that vast storage much more quickly without needing to consult an expert source like a librarian. We performed a competitive analysis on similar aggregator websites, sent out surveys to past visitors of ICPSR's website, interviewed existing users, and created user personas to help frame our approach. Then, we created some low fidelity wireframes in Balsamiq, conducted A/B testing to validate our redesign, and finalized a high-fidelity prototype in Adobe XD to help the client visualize some of the recommendations we thought could improve the ICPSR user experience.      </p>

      <p id = "recent-p2-text">
        This next project looked at the highest selling videogames of all time and the resale value of a
        mint condition physical copy of the game. I hoped to discover whether factors like the release date or the gaming platform contributed to game's worth.
        Used versions of a game are usually pretty cheap, but mint conditions of classics can sell for over $500 on auction sites like eBay.
