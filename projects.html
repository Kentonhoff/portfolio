    <h2>Dance Portfolio</h2>
    <p>
      Aside from user experience design and data analysis, I've started developing an interest in the professional world of dance.
      For one of my classes at the University of Michigan, I was required to create a portfolio of performance reviews,
      biographies on prominent dancers, and an analysis on the topic of dance in the modern world. Dance has shown me the value
      of self expression and how important it is to stay in touch with reality when most of the world is going digital.

    <h2>Doordash Usability Report</h2>
    <p>
      One of my first experiences creating a Usability report involved the delivery app DoorDash. For this report, my group wanted
      to understand the process of ordering food delivery on mobile app, how to define a successful ordering experience,
      and what motivates a college student to choose food delivery. We conducted interviews with students on campus and analyzed their
      responses to discover their attitudes toward delivery apps and their motivation for ordering online.
